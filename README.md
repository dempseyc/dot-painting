# dot-painting
Going back to my roots, seeing how I can apply my better programming skills to my earliest experiments with code.
Many years ago, I had been doing these archaic dot paintings. At the same time or slightly later, I wanted to see what I could do with Flash animation.
When I realized I could program in Flash, I gave up trying animation and just wanted to write code that would paint these
patterns. I re-learned trigonometry. I learned bitwise operations to mix the colors in hexadecimal.
Unforturnately, I can't find my old AS3 code, so I'll have to figure it all out again.
This is the reboot in simple JavaScript with jquery and in the browser.
